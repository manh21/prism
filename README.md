# Project Reality Intelligent Server Manager

PRISM is a powerful administration tool. This tool allows admins to keep an eye on the players in the server as if you were in the game itself, by allowing you to view the map, list of players, chat, and interact using all of the normal RealityAdmin commands.

If you have any issues with the tool, please open an issue in the github repo. If you have any issues with the PRISM server, please contact the PRISM team.
